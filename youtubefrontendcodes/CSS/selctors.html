    <p class="wikipedia">Shivaji I (Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale, Marathi pronunciation: 19 February 1630 3 April 1680 was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle dynasty.[7] Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the Sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Confederacy.

        Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golconda, the Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji offered passage and his service to Aurangzeb to invade the declining Sultanate of Bijapur. After Aurangzeb's departure for the north due to a war of succession, Shivaji conquered territories ceded by Bijapur in the name of the Mughals.[8] : 63  Following the Battle of Purandar, Shivaji entered into vassalage with the Mughal empire, assuming the role of a Mughal chief and was conferred with the title of Raja by Aurangzeb.[9] He undertook military expeditions on behalf of the Mughal empire for a brief duration.[10]
        
        In 1674, Shivaji was coronated as the king despite opposition from local Brahmins.[8] : 87 [11] Praised for his chivalrous treatment of women,[12] Shivaji employed people of all castes and religions, including Muslims[13] and Europeans, in his administration and armed forces.[14] Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy.</p>

            Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near Junnar, which is now in Pune district. Scholars disagree on his date of birth; the Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti).[a][26][27] Shivaji was named after a local deity, the Goddess Shivai Devi.[28][29]

Shivaji belonged to a Maratha family of the Bhonsle clan.[30] Shivaji's father, Shahaji Bhonsle, was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates.[31] His mother was Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri.[32][33] His paternal grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was an influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet of "Raja". He was given deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan, and Indapur to provide for military expenses. He was also given Fort Shivneri for his family's residence
