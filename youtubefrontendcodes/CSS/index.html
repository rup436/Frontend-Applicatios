    <P>Shivaji I (Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale, Marathi pronunciation: 19 February 1630 – 3
        April 1680)[6] was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle dynasty.[7] Shivaji carved out his own
        independent kingdom from the Sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Confederacy.

        Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the
        Sultanate of Golconda, the Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji offered passage and
        his service to Aurangzeb to invade the declining Sultanate of Bijapur. After Aurangzeb's departure for the north
        due to a war of succession, Shivaji conquered territories ceded by Bijapur in the name of the Mughals.[8] : 63 
        Following the Battle of Purandar, Shivaji entered into vassalage with the Mughal empire, assuming the role of a
        Mughal chief and was conferred with the title of Raja by Aurangzeb.[9] He undertook military expeditions on
        behalf of the Mughal empire for a brief duration.[10]

        In 1674, Shivaji was coronated as the king despite opposition from local Brahmins.[8] : 87 [11] Praised for his
        chivalrous treatment of women,[12] Shivaji employed people of all castes and religions, including Muslims[13]
        and Europeans, in his administration and armed forces.[14] Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere
        of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy.

        Shivaji's legacy was revived by Jyotirao Phule about two centuries after his death. Later on, he came to be
        glorified by Indian nationalists such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and appropriated by Hindutva activists.</P>
